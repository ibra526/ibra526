This XML representation defines four blocks:

- Block 1: Initialization - sets the state, digit odd, digit even, martingale, stop loss, and target profit.
- Block 2: Trade Options - sets the duration, ticks, and stake for trading.
- Block 3: Purchase Condition - checks the even count loss and odd count loss conditions and performs actions accordingly.
- Block 4: Restart Condition - trades again.

Note that this is just one possible way to represent the given blocks in XML, and there may be other valid representations as well.
